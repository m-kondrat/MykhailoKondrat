## Hi there, I'm Mykhailo 👋
I was a UI/UX designer, but one day, 5 years ago, I opened VIM and still don't know how to exit—so I’ve been a full-time developer ever since.

Currently, I’m working as a software developer at Ericsson.

In my day-to-day work, I use TypeScript, React, Python, and FastAPI.

In my free time, I like to develop cool things with some technologies I don't have a chance to use in my daily work. 


### My projects

<a href="https://marsogram.web.app">MarsoGram</a>  - Like instagram but for Mars Rovers
